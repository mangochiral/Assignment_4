## Description
 
The first part of the code in this project makes a vector first 50 natural numbers and return a 5X10 logical matrix, wherein it returns true every number divisible by 3 or has a remainder of 1 when divided by 6. Then another matrix made, wherein the numeric value are extracted from truth value the logical matrix. Furthermore, this numeric value were operated on by a hailstone function, wherein if x is odd, x multiplied by 3 and add 1, otherwise divide x by 2. This process repeated until the number is 1 for which the number of the cycles are record before reaching 1.
The Second part of the code does data cleaning by removing string value columns, derives range of each column, calculates mean of each column in the dataframe, and executes removal of rows that had miles/gallon(mpg) less than the mean, and post removal of rows new means were calculated for each column.
